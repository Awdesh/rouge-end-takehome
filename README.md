## Overview

The implementation makes web requests to the SF Government . The offset is determined by the size of the response payload.

The implementation takes into consideration the user input to continue returning more requests. If the user enters `Y`, then additional request is made to the backend client.

For the application to work without throttling, it is recommended that the API token be generated by the users to make API request calls. The users can sign up for an app token [at this link](https://data.sfgov.org/profile/app_tokens).
